# Hand_guesture_rating_DeepLearning_Model
Its a Deep Learning CNN Model which helps in guesing the hand guestures like one finger for 1 and  2 fingure for 2 Max rating 3.The CNN model is trained using python, openCV, TensorFlow, MatplotLib in Google Colab.
And the trained model is been converted to TensorFlow lite file So, that the file can be used in mobile Applications purposes.
Steps:
1.Collect the data.
2.Normalize the data and using openCV and use pickle to store the objects of labels and the images in it.
3.Upload the pickle files to the drive.
4.Login to Google Colab and mount your drive.
5.Fetch the data and train the model using TensorFlow.
6.Test the trained model with a test data.
7.Convert the model to Tflite file and quantize the model.
8.Test the model after quantization.
9.And succesfully download the file.
